# Hello there! 👋

My name is Viktor. Welcome to my own little digital world!

I am currently studying Software Engineering with Python 🐍 at Software University (SoftUni), i've also dabbled in some JS, HTML and CSS as well as QA Testing 🕷️.

I have worked on some really small projects like an AI image generator🎨, a simple platformer using Pygame 🕹️ and i am also in the process of developing a website/portfolio for my music production alias "Voorhees"🎵. 

I also have some experience with the GODOT game engine which i'm currently using for the development of a 2D zelda-like rpg ⚔️🛡️. 

I am very passionate about video games so once i master Python i will start learning C# in the hopes of one day landing a job in the Video Game Industry 👾🎮

 <summary><h3>👨🏽‍💻 Vik's Hobbies🎵🕹️ </h3></summary>
   🎵
   Apart from my passion for all things tech my first love was music.
   I am a self taught guitarist and music producer, i've fronted several bands and helped in the recording process for some local musicians in my teenage years. 
   I am currently making house music under my alias "Voorhees" in the hopes of some day landing a record deal.
   
   🕹️
   Video games have also been a big part of my life since I received my first PC at the tender age of 5. I've been hooked ever since! 
   My favourite genre is RPG. My top three series are:

   * Mass effect 
   * The Elder Scrolls
   * Dragon Age
   
   One honarable mention is World of Warcraft. I got hooked when TBC launched and it's been in my life ever since. 
   
   I've composed music for some small indie projects and i also did some level design as well. 

   Anyways, thats all the stuff i can think of, thank you for taking the time to read through all this !😃
